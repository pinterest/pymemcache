"""
A comprehensive, fast, pure-Python memcached client library.

Basic Usage:
------------

 from pymemcache.client import Client

 client = Client(('localhost', 11211))
 client.set('some_key', 'some_value')
 result = client.get('some_key')


Serialization:
--------------

 import json
 from pymemcache.client import Client

 def json_serializer(key, value):
     if type(value) == str:
         return value, 1
     return json.dumps(value), 2

 def json_deserializer(key, value, flags):
     if flags == 1:
         return value
     if flags == 2:
         return json.loads(value)
     raise Exception("Unknown serialization format")

 client = Client(('localhost', 11211), serializer=json_serializer,
                 deserializer=json_deserializer)
 client.set('key', {'a':'b', 'c':'d'})
 result = client.get('key')


Best Practices:
---------------

 - Always set the connect_timeout and timeout arguments in the constructor to
   avoid blocking your process when memcached is slow.
 - Use the "noreply" flag for a significant performance boost. The "noreply"
   flag is enabled by default for "set", "add", "replace", "append", "prepend",
   and "delete". It is disabled by default for "cas", "incr" and "decr". It
   obviously doesn't apply to any get calls.
 - Use get_many and gets_many whenever possible, as they result in less
   round trip times for fetching multiple keys.
 - Use the "ignore_exc" flag to treat memcache/network errors as cache misses
   on calls to the get* methods. This prevents failures in memcache, or network
   errors, from killing your web requests. Do not use this flag if you need to
   know about errors from memcache, and make sure you have some other way to
   detect memcache server failures.

    Keys and Values:
    ----------------

     Keys must have a __str__() method which should return a str with no more
     than 250 ASCII characters and no whitespace or control characters. Unicode
     strings must be encoded (as UTF-8, for example) unless they consist only
     of ASCII characters that are neither whitespace nor control characters.

     Values must have a __str__() method to convert themselves to a byte string.
     Unicode objects can be a problem since str() on a Unicode object will
     attempt to encode it as ASCII (which will fail if the value contains
     code points larger than U+127). You can fix this will a serializer or by
     just calling encode on the string (using UTF-8, for instance).

     If you intend to use anything but str as a value, it is a good idea to use
     a serializer and deserializer. The pymemcache.serde library has some
     already implemented serializers, including one that is compatible with
     the python-memcache library.

    Serialization and Deserialization:
    ----------------------------------

     The constructor takes two optional functions, one for "serialization" of
     values, and one for "deserialization". The serialization function takes
     two arguments, a key and a value, and returns a tuple of two elements, the
     serialized value, and an integer in the range 0-65535 (the "flags"). The
     deserialization function takes three parameters, a key, value and flags
     and returns the deserialized value.

     Here is an example using JSON for non-str values:

      def serialize_json(key, value):
          if type(value) == str:
              return value, 1
          return json.dumps(value), 2

      def deserialize_json(key, value, flags):
          if flags == 1:
              return value
          if flags == 2:
              return json.loads(value)
          raise Exception("Unknown flags for value: {1}".format(flags))

    Error Handling:
    ---------------

     All of the methods in this class that talk to memcached can throw one of
     the following exceptions:

      * MemcacheUnknownCommandError
      * MemcacheClientError
      * MemcacheServerError
      * MemcacheUnknownError
      * MemcacheUnexpectedCloseError
      * MemcacheIllegalInputError
      * socket.timeout
      * socket.error

     Instances of this class maintain a persistent connection to memcached
     which is terminated when any of these exceptions are raised. The next
     call to a method on the object will result in a new connection being made
     to memcached.
